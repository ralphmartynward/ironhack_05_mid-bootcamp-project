## Project Description

This project is a movie analysis based on data from imdb.com, and a crossover of a big sample of all of the movies I have seen. 
The goal is to play with some of the data science tools we have learned in the bootcamp, and to have fun with the data. 
I will explore a few questions and the ultimate goal will be to create a recommendation system for movies based on my own taste.
